    description: "At Pratt & Whitney, my group combines computer science and mechanical engineering to develop applications which bolster and facilitate discipline practices. Over the past one and a half years, I’ve found my true passion in computer science and have sought roles within the company to further my skill set. Presently, I am the lead developer of an application designed to standardize and enable traceability on all durability analyses across hot section engineering. I also engage in the standardization of all Python versions and packages across the company through AWS and Anaconda. I am introducing HTML5 based GUIs to streamline the development of modern looking cross-platform applications. My time at Pratt & Whitney has provided me experience in a field that I’m excited to continue pursuing."

    position: "B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, earned May 2017",
    description: "WPI provided me with many different opportunities to discover and develop my passions for design and engineering. In my first and second years, I was exposed to computer-aided design (CAD). I found I really enjoyed the design process and started working towards becoming a design engineer. I spent two internships in the field and later on became a teaching assistant for the Intro. to CAD course at WPI. In my third and fourth years, I took Intro. to Computer Science as an elective and discovered I enjoyed programming for the very same reason I enjoy design: for the sheer joy of making things. I went on to complete many projects using one or both fields such as programming a robot to play Jenga, designing 3D printed parts to predict deformation, and developing particle tracking software for use in the design process of jet engine turbine blades. WPI helped me discover two of my many passions and provided me with the resources and opportunities to hone my skills."

    position: "Design Engineer Intern, Summer 2014+2015",
    description: "From my class experiences, I explored a career as a design engineer through two internships at ebm-papst, an electric motor and fan manufacturer. I improved functional testing through designing and enhancing testing rigs. Further, I increased production capability by creating machine tooling fixtures for manufacturing processes. Lastly, I aided marketing by building a product display to highlight the capability of a new product line by varying inlet area. My experience at ebm-papst developed my skills as a designer, team member, and leader."
